# Emerging-Technologies-Project
By Donal McGahon - G00299627


The following are your instructions to complete the project for the module Emerging Technologies for 2017. This project is worth 40% of your marks for the module. Please see the course homepage for the deadline.

### Overview

In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. You should use tensorflow and flask to do this. Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.
