# Emerging-Technologies-Project
By Donal McGahon - G00299627

## Why I created this application to recognise digits in images
* This was a project given to me for my final year in Software Development in the subject of [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/)
* The project outline was as follows:
In this project you will create a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. Users will be able to visit the web application through their browser, submit (or draw) an image containing a single digit, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. You should use tensorflow and flask to do this. Note that accuracy of approximately 99% is considered excellent in recognising digits, so it is okay if your algorithm gets it wrong sometimes.
* Instructions
1. Create a git repository with a README.md and an appropriate gitignore file. The README should explain who you are, why you created the application, how you created it, how to download and run it, and summarise any references you have used.
1. In the repository, create a web application that serves a HTML page as the root resource. The page should contain an input where the user can upload (or draw) an image containing a digit, and an area to display the image and the digit.
1. Add a route to your application that accepts requests containing a user input image and responds with the digit.
1. Connect the HTML page to the route using AJAX.

## How to run application
1. Download or clone the repository
1. Run cmd on your machine and navigate to the folders location
1. Run the application by running the app.py file using the following line -
``` python app.py ```
1. The following http link should appear  "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)" and you should navigate to this link on your browser
